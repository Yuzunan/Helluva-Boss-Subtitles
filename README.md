# HelluvaBossSubtitles
These are English subtitles for Helluva Boss episodes. 
You need to download the original video for them to work.
By opening your video application app, you can select .str or .ass files to the current video. Those are .ass files.
The .ass files make it possible to have 2 different subtitles at the same time, to choose the placement, the color, and many other things.
I'll update this repository often, since I rewatch the episodes many times and I'll keep uploading the subtitles for the recents episodes.

/!\ Just so you know /!\.
The style between S1 and S2 changed (bold letter in S2) because I got better with these and I kinda want to keep S1 subtitles as they already are.
